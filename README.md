### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Kim, Sohmee
I am a undergraduate student at University of Texas at Austin, interested in Neuroscience research and data analysis!

I am interested in understanding how the brain interacts with external stimuli and allows each person to have a unique persepctive on the world. So, I wish to pursue a career in neuroscience research, untangling the mysteries of the mind. To do so, I believe learning basic programming skills and data science skills are crucial.
