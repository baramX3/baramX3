I am an undergraduate student at Unversity of Texas at Austin (Austin, TX USA) and a newbie to programming.

I am most interested in studying how the brain interprets external stimuli to create unique perceptions of the world. I wish to pursue a career in neuroscience research. So, I hope to apply my programming and data analysis skills to research, unraveling the mysteries of the brain.

In my spare time, I like to read books, watch TV, and sleep- essentially, just relax.
