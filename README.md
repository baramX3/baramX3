I am an undergraduate student, majoring in neuroscience, at Unversity of Texas at Austin (Austin, TX USA).

I am most interested in studying how the brain percieves outside information and interprets it to create unique perceptions of the world. I am currently interested in going to graduate school and pursuing a career in neuroscience research. So, I hope to apply my programming and data analysis skills to research projects, unraveling the mysteries of the brain.

In my spare time, I like to read books, watch TV, and sleep- essentially, just relax.
